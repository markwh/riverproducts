## Welcome

This application is a demonstration of river data products from the SWOT satellite mission. The tabs above this text each navigate to a different aspect of the data products; it is recommended to go through them in order from left to right. 

### Prior Database

We rely on some a priori information about the SWOT-observable rivers, independent of satellite observations. This includes geographic information about river centerlines, as well as definitions of the reaches and nodes to which SWOT observations will be assigned. 

You can zoom in and out on the map at left to see prior-defined nodes and reaches in the Sacramento River case.
