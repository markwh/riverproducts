## Pixels

Pixels from the PIXC and PIXCVec product are shown in the map at left for a subset of nodes. This subset is necessary for displaying the data without overloading map.

*Note that this does not display all pixel cloud pixles--only those that were assigned to a node. This automatically excludes land-only pixels and any water pixels not contiguous with the main river segment.*

You can change which nodes' pixels are displayed using the slider below. Zoom in and click a node to see some of the data it contains. The full set of PIXC and PIXCVec data is shown in the table below.
