## Passes and tiles

Each orbit that the satellite makes is split at the poles into 2 **passes**. Shown in the map at left are 3 different passes that will observe the Sacramento River. 

The data gathered by the satellite will be divided into **tiles**, the spatial granule used for distributing the data. Each tile extends approximately 64 km along-track and 64 km perpendicular to the pass. The footprints of 4 different tiles are shown on the map. Click the tiles for identification.  

*Note: the tiles shown are not the same as those SWOT will use, as their along-track locations and extents were chosen for convenience of simulation for this river.*
